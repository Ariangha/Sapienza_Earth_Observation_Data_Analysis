# vineyard_growth_assessment
This project monitors vineyard growth in South Pavia using NDVI (optical) and NRCS (radar) to compare North-South vs East-West row orientations, and analyzes the March 2021 Greece Earthquake with InSAR imagery to detect fringe patterns, measuring ground deformation and crustal displacement.
